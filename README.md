**Bryan**

- Trying to set the code up. Working on navigation bar and footer to add to `app.vue` page
- Got a very basic navbar and footer but now for some reason the content on the root index.vue page and TheFooter is being displayed twice

  - Have tried to delete and re-add content: not working
  - Reloaded the page: not working
  - Reloaded the server: not working

- Went for lunch and when I came back I started the server back up and the issue was just fixed... 'gotta love technology'
- Trying to add links to navbar with as little code as possible

![Version 4 NuxtLinks](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/97326786/162542281-c50b29d4-2245-438f-9027-57ef4832d75e.png)


- But was having a hard time figuring it out, so for the sake of time I'll just do all my links as separate Nuxt links8
- Starting on hero section
- Was trying to make an `AppButton` for the hero section CTA but I was unable to figure out how to pass a url as a prop
- So the hero cta(s) have to be added manually which isn't the worst thing because some pages don't have a cta on their hero section
- Making the navigation bar and hero section responsive
- Good so far!
- Going back to an earlier issue that I had. Made the hero section into a proper reusable component but using a `<slot>` for the image section
- Now working on the short about me section that is part of the landing page
- Was having a hard time getting an image to render... Then I realized I had named the `<slot>` something different than what I was using to invoke it! (A+ detetive work)
- After that it was trying to get everything to align properly
- Now to work on the blog cards section
- I noticed that the title used is the same throughout most of the site so I decided to make an `AppTitle` component to just make it that much easier
- Made some very quick cards - Not optimized at all
- Trying to work from a mobile first approach from here on out
- Working on Featured Article section
  - starting with a mobile first approach
  - done with the mobile approach
  - Working on it as a full page now
  - Using grid box and flex box on the same element is kind of a pain in the butt :'( but we are getting there
  - Forgot to add `sm:` and `md:` but I was simple enough to add those and make it work for both mobile and computer users
- Featured Article Section complete!
- For the blog cards I just used the `AppCard` and was able to just copy and paste what I needed
- Working on contact page
  - used the hero component
  - used our previous form assignment to build the contact page form
- Working on footer because it kept popping up in the middle of the pages
- Added a class of `class="h-full"` to the `app.vue` page and that seem to solve the issue
- Added a link to the github repo of this assignment in the footer
- Going to go through and change whatever images and text I had as a placeholder
- Attributions added for content used
